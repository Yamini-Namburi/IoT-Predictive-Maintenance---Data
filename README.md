Coceptual Diagram :

At a high level, we capture where, what, when, and why of sensor activity:

Factory → Area → Machine → Sensor
(Hierarchical structure of physical equipment)

Sensor Reading records measurements from each sensor every few seconds.

Maintenance Event records scheduled or unscheduled maintenance.

Out-of-Tolerance Alert records instances where readings exceed predefined safe ranges.
